# Skyblock_Guild_Events
Automating the process of hosting Skyblock-related guild events.


This project will help me automate the process of hosting Skyblock-related events. This project helps me track stats, like Skill, Catacombs or Slayer XP over the duration of our ongoing event. It collects the neccessary data and stores it in CSV files for me to import to Power BI to make graphs off.
